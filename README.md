        <p>I'm from India, and I have pursued an MS in Engineering in AI at Woosong University, South Korea. I love learning new technologies and working on innovative projects. In my third semester, I took a course on Large Language Models (LLMs), and I would like to deepen my knowledge in this field as part of my studies. In my free time, I enjoy watching movies, traveling, and playing sports. .</p>
        <p> I'm so happy that i had created my self introduction website for first time</p>
        <p> THANK YOU</p>
